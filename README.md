# matplotlib-challenge
This repository contains a jupyter notebook program analyzing multiple CSV files containing information regarding mice with tumors being tested on different drug regimens. The program will produce summary tables, as well as multiple charts and graphs to illustrate trends in each drug's effectiveness.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scipy

### Analysis
1. Capomulin and Ramicane seemed to be the 2 most successful Drug Regimens considering the average tumor size of all the drugs regimens used.
2. Ketapril and Naftisol seemed to be the 2 lease reliable Drug Regimens (even more so than the placebo) as they had the highest variance in tumor size.
3. From the line plot of mouse l509 on Capomulin, it can be seen that there is a general downward trend in tumor size which can be used to infer that if the treatment was continued, the tumor would continue to decrease in size.
